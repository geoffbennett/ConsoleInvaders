You need to ensure your console is set to 80 x 30 characters, or things will look a bit 60's freak out...

## Todo
- [ ] Optimise all the things!! (Nested loops within loops within loops within...)
- [ ] There's code that could be refactored to DRY it up a little
- [ ] Colour!!
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Get the high-score working
- [ ] Get player 2 working
- [ ] Add the mothership
- [ ] Add levels with increasing difficulty instead of just "winning"
- [ ] Automatically size the console correctly
